                <p>o be honest, I was completely blown away how beautiful, organized and clean the country is. I visited Geneva, Lausanne and a few smaller places between and on my way to Italy (Liddes, Montreux, Nyon).

                    Aside from the cities which were both enjoyable and beautiful, I was especially fascinated with the landscape while we were driving. It looks so beautiful, on the border of looking like it came out of a picture of some kind. It’s also a country that is the complete polar opposite of my own and to see how it is well organized and how everything functions so well, made me wish I could live there.
                    
                    In any case, Switzerland is an absolute marvel - and I’m looking forward to visiting it again.</p>

                <p>The quality of the homes and the built environment was superb. When I got back home to Winnipeg, I thought to myself, 'This place is a dump!'
                    So, thanks for ruining my home town for me! And the same thing happened with chocolate.</p>
